# otc-repo
The OTC-App is a web application written in the Python-based Framework Django. Its central function is a calender where members of a tennis club can book one of three tennis courts for private training sessions. Additionally the site administrator can insert his official group trainings and events of the tennis club. Another feature is the management of costs for externals who can also use the tennis courts together with internals.
